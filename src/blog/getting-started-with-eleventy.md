title: Getting started with Eleventy
---

Today I've installed and tried [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) for the first time. It's a great tool for building static websites.

## Getting started
Open wsl and install node and npm.
```bash	
sudo apt install curl dirmngr apt-transport-https lsb-release ca-certificates
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -

sudo apt install nodejs
```

Create a new git repository, call it 11ty-blog. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone <repository url>
cd 11ty-blog
```

Once done we need to initialize the project.
```bash
npm init -y
```

Install 11ty
```bash
npm install @11ty/eleventy
```

Edit the package.json start script.
```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "eleventy --serve"
}
```

Create the first index.md to test.
```markdown
# Hello world
```

Add a start script to VS Code and run it to start eleventy.
Watch your glorious SSG.
